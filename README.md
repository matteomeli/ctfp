# Category Theory for Programmers

Following along Bartosz Milewski's Category Theory for Programmers.

This is a collection of notes and solutions to the challenges proposed in the [book](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf).

Where possible, I will use Rust to solve the practical challenges presented. I am still learning Rust, so code won't be as best as it could. Might also use Scala or C++ as alternatives where it makes sense.
